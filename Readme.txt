I needed to document this little project, for I want to possibly utilize this as a go to in case I need for professional improvement... To begin, I wanted to add a landing page as a means to house the links or act as a hub to the different tools in which I have either already built out, building out or planning on. This is a means to help me become more productive in my current employment, and as such, I am performing this in my own time to maintain rights to everything I produce. If the current employ would like to utilize any of my tools exclusively, then they must come to an agreement to my terms in both use and pricing. 

That being said, I'm starting with the landing page first, roughing it out until it is to my liking. I already have built out an estimating tool for run-time on the finish-line that I will import into this repo instead of separately. I think that would keep everything nice and tidy and easy to modify. 

This will need to focus on looking excellent on mobile-first, as is most of everything I attempt to do in such a manner. This is primarily because the targeted audiance will be my coworkers who will have more access to their cell/smart phones more readily accessible than a desktop. 

The boiler-plate for how the tools should be displayed on the landing page should look like this:
<div class="tool">
    <div class="toolHeader">
        <h2>Tool Name</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="toolDesc">
        <p>Tool Description</p>
    </div>
    <div class="toolLink">
        <button>
            <a href="#">Go To Tool</a>
        </button>
    </div>
</div>
